# Basic js-codes which I practice at the time of learning js-code:
1.Here is my first assignment where i learn about variables,data type, conversion of data type etc.here the link [assignment1](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/blob/main/assignment1.js)

2.In my second assignment i learned about the arithmatic operators(sum,substraction,multiplication,division,remainder,exponentiation),conditional statement(if,else,else if) etc.hete the link[assignment.2](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/blob/main/assignment2.js) 

3.In my third assignment i learned about the uses of logical operators(and,or,not), for loop.here the link  is[assignment.3](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/blob/main/assignment3.js)

4.In my fourth assignment i learned about the function( anatomy of function,using of a function, optional parameters,passing parapeters)etc.here the link[assignment.5](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/blob/main/assignment5.js)

5. here i made a black and white image by changing the pixel value from array which was already made.here the picture link[black and white image](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/commit/ca49c27cc431234d9a95ba97b199f6cfb00f381a)

6. its a RGB image where Red,Green,Blue colours are separated.here the image link[RGB image](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/blob/main/separated_R_G_B(1).png)

7.Its a table whhich containing data(band name,wavvelength,pixel, description) of 3 satelites.here is the link [Data table](https://github.com/maria-rahman-mila/Assignment-codes/blob/main/satelite data.pdf)
